3. Inkscape for making vector image

4. For vector to g-code visit: jscut.org


**Note:** while making vector image using inkscape make all dimentions in mm also make sure the drawing is on the positive x and y axis.
      because the python program neglects negative coordinates.The image can be shifted to the negative axes of the robot's workspace 
      by assigning shifts in mm to "xerr" and "yerr" variable in the main python program.
